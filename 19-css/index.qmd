## Computational Social Science

For this lecture's notes, please see:

* [Lecture slides](hhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UmkNWQJdoEzsiM7H2DrkV9ghUkiaiN1o733bDC4uaYE/edit?usp=sharing).

Focus on understanding what **coding** means in qualitative social science research.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large language models (LLMs) are the hallmark of machine learning models for generative AI. They are a subset of generative models, because they generate a response to user input.

Focus on:
* Understanding the difference between an LLM (e.g., GPT) and a chatbot that uses an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
* Know that chatbots can be powered by different models, which have different capacities.
* Understand the risks of hallucinations and other inaccuracies when it comes to generative models.
