An array is a sequential collection of values of a given data type:\n\nsequential: arranged like a line/queue\ncollection: multiple values organized together.\n\nIn arrays, each value is called an array element.\nWe have previously discussed the idea of tables: a rectangular data structure with rows and columns.

We can do so via a range of functions from different sources.\nHere are some starter arrays to get us going. What are the resulting arrays created?\n\nint_arr = make_array(3, -4, 0, 5, 2)\nstr_arr = make_array(\"cm\", \"m\", \"in\", \"ft\", \"yd\")\nempty_arr = make_array() # challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrays created\n\n\n\n\n\n\nint_arr\n\narray([ 3, -4,  0,  5,  2])\n\n\n\nstr_arr\n\narray(['cm', 'm', 'in', 'ft', 'yd'],\n      dtype='&lt;U2')\n\n\nAn empty array is one with no elements:\n\nempty_arr\n\narray([], dtype=float64)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will describe the syntax and terminology of built-in and NumPy functions below, then provide a table of operations. Here’s how we suggest working through this section:\n\nDon’t memorize these functions!\nInstead, remember there are two types of functions for arrays: built-in functions and NumPy functions.\nGet familiar with two tables, copied below. Get familiar with reading this tabl documentation to understand how each function works.\nWhen writing your programs, look through these functions and see which function(s) can compose your solution.\n\n\nBuilt-in functions\nSome built-in functions (i.e., included with Python) can take in arrays as arguments.\nHere is a table of example built-in functions for arrays. Again, don’t memorize the functions. Rather, get familiar with reading and predicting their outputs.\n\nBuilt-in Python functions that take in array arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpression and Return value\nExample(s)\n\n\n\n\nlen(arr) Length of an array, providing the number of elements it contains. Useful for determining the size of an array dynamically.\nlen(str_arr)   # 5  len(empty_arr) # 0\n\n\nmax(arr) The largest value within an array.\nmax(int_arr)    # 5  max(str_arr)   # 'yd'\n\n\nmin(arr) The smallest value within an array.\nmin(int_arr)\n\n\nsum(arr) Sum of all values in an array.\nsum(int_arr)   # 6  sum(str_arr)   # TypeError\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 1: Argument data types\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that even though function names can be identical, call expressions can evaluate differently depending on the argument data type. len(arg), for example, returns an integer value indicating the “length” of the argument arg. If arg is a string, it returns the number of characters; if arg is an array, it returns the number of elements.\n\nlen(str_arr)\n\n5\n\n\n\nlen(str_arr.item(0)) # what is the argument here?\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 2: Expressions with string arrays\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you may have noticed above, calling these functions on strings return some seemingly bizarre values. After all, what does it mean to get the maximum value of an array of strings?\nInstead of erroring out, the Pythonic convention is to consider alphabetic sorting as a way of ordering elements—hence, \"yd\" comes alphabetically after \"cm\" and \"ft\", and so on.\nWe will not cover string comparisons in detail in this course. If you are curious about these algorithms, we encourage you to take a Data Structures course!\n\n\n\nLet’s use these built-in functions to compute the average (mean) value of the below array. We will discuss measures of average much later in this course.\n\narr = make_array(30, -40, -4.5, 0, 35)\navg = sum(arr)/len(arr)\navg\n\n4.0999999999999996\n\n\nDue to approximations in how the computer stores and operates on floats, the above number is as close to 4.1 (the true numeric average) as we can get with our Python calculator. Take a computer systems or computer architecture course for more information!\n\n\nNumPy functions\nNumPy (pronounced “NUM-pie”) is a Python library with convenient and powerful modules and functions for manipulating arrays. Any time we want to use NumPy, we must write an import statement:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\narr = make_array(30, -40, -4.5, 0, 35)\narr\n\narray([ 30. , -40. ,  -4.5,   0. ,  35. ])\n\n\nAfter putting this statement at the top of our notebook, we can then prepend np. to call a NumPy function. The below NumPy function call computes averages much more conveniently than our clever (but verbose) expression with built-in function calls, though it still suffers from floating point approximations:\n\nnp.average(arr)\n\n4.0999999999999996\n\n\n\n\nNumPy Array Function Table\nThere are many, many types of NumPy array functions; the below table only scratches the surface of what is possible. Again, instead of memorizing functions, we encourage you to learn how to read documentation by considering the following:\n\nWhat is the function name? How is this name informed by the function description?\nWhat is the return value of this function?\n\nIf the data type of the return value is an array, is it the same length as the original array? Is the function therefore operating element-wise on the original array?\nIf the data type of the return value is a single value, how is this value computed from the different elements of the original array?\n\nIs the function changing the contents of the original array?\n\nThe answer to question 3 is no for all array functions we will cover in this course. All array functions return a new array.\n\nA subset of NumPy array functions. A full reference is in the Data 6 reference sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumPy function\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnp.average(arr)  np.mean(arr)\nThe average (i.e., mean) value of arr\n\n\nnp.sum(arr)\nThe sum of all elements in arr\n\n\nnp.prod(arr)\nThe product of all elements in arr\n\n\nnp.count_nonzero(arr)\nThe number of elements in arr that are not equal to 0\n\n\nnp.diff(arr)\nThe difference between each element and the previous one value of arr. Returns an array of length 1 less than the original.\n\n\nnp.cumsum(arr)\nThe cumulative sum of all elements in arr.\n\n\nnp.sqrt(arr)\nThe square roots of each element in arr.\n\n\nnp.log(arr)\nThe natural logarithm of each element in arr.\n\n\nnp.log10(arr)\nThe base-10 logarithm of each element in arr.\n\n\n\nRefer to the lecture notebook for example call expressions involving these NumPy functions. Refer to the Data 6 reference sheet for all functions we will expect you to be familiar with (not memorize!) in this course."

All members of the course community—the instructor, GSIs, students, tutors, and readers—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect.\nYou will be interacting with course staff and fellow students in several different environments: in class, in lab, over the discussion forum, and in office hours. Some of these will be in person, some of them will be online, but the same expectations hold: be kind, be respectful, be professional.\nIf you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by other students or course staff, please come talk to us about it."

    "text": "🔧 Computational Tools\nWe will be mainly using the computing and programming environment R (via RStudio) to analyze data in this class. We may also ask you to use a command line interface to interact with your operating system. You do need your own computer to use R and do the assignments.\nWe don’t expect that students have already been exposed to R. For those who come from Data 8 or some previous coding experience in python, the first labs will help you transfer that knowledge over to R. Both languages are excellent platforms for analyzing data, are widely used in data science, and have their individual strengths. R has been developed within the statistics community specifically for data analysis, while python is a general-purpose programming language but has large data analysis capabilities.\nThe lectures tend to be focused on the data analysis concepts, while learning how to apply/use them in R tend to be the focus of the labs and assignments. Do not be surprised or worried about not following the details of R code during class—that is not the point (furthermore, there will sometimes be code that is really specific to the instructional purposes of the lecture, e.g. to make a specific plot, and is beyond the scope of what you would be expected to understand or know how to do it by yourself)."

I will do this only if I made the assignment or exam harder than I intended, and no one’s scores will decrease as a result of the curve. This will happen very rarely, probably not at all.\nTo give you a rough idea of the grading scheme, the assignment of letter grades in previous semesters has been as follows:\n\n😀 90-100% (Excellent) A-/A/A+ range\n🙂 80-90% (Good) B-/B/B+ range\n😐 70-80% (Fair) C-/C/C+ range\n🙁 60-70% (Deficient) D\n😞 Below 60% (Failed) F\n\nIf you are taking the class pass-fail, the cut-oﬀ for passing is 70% (C-).\nAs a matter of course policy, I do not round up when calculating letter grades. Ex: if your overall score is 79.9999%, then the highest letter grade that you can expect is a C+, not a B-.\nThere is no curve; your grade will depend only on how well you do, and not on how well everyone else does.\nLetter grades are final; I don’t enter into negotiations with students about grades.\nPlease do not engage in grade grubbing.\nAlso, please remember that we grade your course performance, not your personal worth."

Inference involves quantifying our degree of certainty: will the patterns that we found in our data also appear in new observations? How accurate are our predictions? Our primary tools for exploration are visualizations and descriptive statistics, for prediction are machine learning and optimization, and for inference are statistical tests and models.\n\nFrom Data 8 (1.1 Introduction):\n\nData are descriptions of the world around us, collected through observation and stored on computers.

In this class, we use the Python 3 programming language. It is powerful and widely used in many computing applications, from web development, scripting, and scientific computing to data science and machine learning. It’s also extremely popular worldwide (Statista, 2025).\nComputer programs are nothing more than recipes: we write programs that tell the computer exactly what to do, and it does exactly that—nothing more, and nothing less.\nYou may be wondering—how can computers be simultaneously so powerful and so primitive? Why does everything in today’s age involve computers or computational technology? In part, this “age of computing” can considered as a complex system of advanced programs run on powerful computing machines to transform complex data. All three of these components involve human scientists and engineers: to write and design the programs, to collect and structure the data, and to design and build the computing machines.",

Development, also known as process of designing, iterating, and testing computer programs, often takes place in an environment which can support all of these tasks.\nThe environment we will use is Jupyter Notebook, which allows us to write and run code within a single .ipynb document (i.e., notebook). They also allow us to embedded text and code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example of a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot going on in the above Jupyter Notebook screenshot: there is code, there is output from running code, there are pictures, and there is (non-code) text. We’ll get to understanding all of these components in due time.\nBut this screenshot also elucidates why a tool like Jupyter Notebook is so important to doing data science work. Data Science often requires the use of computation and visualizations and the production of written reports. Notebooks support all three of these, in the same document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Project Jupyter community actually started at UC Berkeley.

    "text": "Jupyter Notebook Internals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf you have not yet tried interacting with your first Jupyter Notebook yet, this section will not make much sense. We recommend skipping ahead to the next set of notes, then coming back and referring to this as you build more notebooks.\n\n\nJupyter Notebooks are made up of cells. There are two main types of cells:\nCode cells. This is where you write and execute code. When run, Python code cells are evaluated as a Python code snippet, one line at a time. The cell output displayed is the value of the last evaluated expression:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Both expressions are evaluated, but the result of the last expression’s evaluation is considered the output of the code cell.\n\n\n\n\nWe will discuss this output/display phenomenon more in future notes.\nTo run a code cell, you can either hit the “Run” button in the Toolbar, or you can use a keyboard shortcut: &lt;SHIFT&gt;+&lt;ENTER&gt;, which runs the cell and advances to the next cell. We recommend keyboard shortcuts; see below.\nMarkdown cells. This is where you write text and images that aren’t Python code. Markdown is a language used for formatting text. A Markdown cell will always display its formatting when it is not in edit mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Left screenshot shows un-evaluated code cell and raw Markdown cell; right screenshot shows evaluated code cell and formatted text. To render formatted text for a selected markdown cell, exit editing mode for that cell. This screenshot starts with the code cell selected, then runs both that code cell and “runs” the markdown cell below.\n\n\n\n\nHere is a guide to Markdown formatting. You’ll explore Markdown more in lab.\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nWhile you can manage most of your notebook development by leveraging the Toolbar, many programmers (including me!) prefer using keyboard shortcuts. This minimizes use of the mouse/trackpad and keeps the hands on the keyboard. Together with stretching and taking breaks, keyboard shortcuts will reduce wrist cramps and improve your programming concentration.\nEdit mode vs. command mode: Hit the &lt;ESCAPE&gt; key on your keyboard to switch from edit mode to command mode. Keyboard shortcuts are specific to the mode you’re using:\n\nEdit mode: when you’re actively typing in the cell. Undo is &lt;CTRL/CMD&gt; + Z.\nCommand mode: when you’re not actively typing in the cell. Undo is z.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\nMode\nKeyboard shortcut\n\n\n\n\nRun cell + jump to next cell*\nEither (puts you in edit mode)\n&lt;SHIFT&gt; + &lt;ENTER&gt;\n\n\nRun cell + stay on this cell\nEither (puts you in edit mode)\n&lt;CTRL/CMD&gt; + &lt;ENTER&gt;\n\n\nSave notebook\nEither\n&lt;CTRL/CMD&gt; + &lt;S&gt;\n\n\nSwitch to command mode*\nEither (puts you in command mode)\n&lt;ESCAPE&gt;\n\n\nSwitch to edit mode*\nCommand\n&lt;ENTER&gt;\n\n\nComment out the current line\nEdit\n&lt;CTRL/CMD&gt; + /\n\n\nCreate new cell above/below\nCommand\nA/B\n\n\nDelete cell\nCommand\nDD\n\n\nConvert cell to Markdown\nCommand\nM\n\n\nConvert cell to code\nCommand\nY\n\n\nShow all shortcuts\nCommand\nH\n\n\n\nThe above table should be used as a reference throughout the semester; don’t try to memorize these right now. And remember, you don’t have to use these shortcuts; you can always use the toolbar. Regardless, we’ve annotated the most useful keyboard shortcuts with an asterisk (*).\nThere are plenty more keyboard shortcuts available. Let us know if you find a good guide.",

Consider the following assignment statement:\n\nx = 3\n\nThis statement assigns the name x to the value 3. Like a suitcase tag, the name x is bound to the value 3.\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\nPython first evaluates the expression on the right-hand side of the = assignment operator, then binds the name x to the resulting value.\nThe below statement re-assigns the name x. Think of this as moving the suitcase tag to a different suitcase.\n\nx = 1 + 2 * 3 - 4 // 5\nx\n\n7\n\n\n\nA note on function calls\nWe will use the term function call interchangeably with call expression. You will see why when we talk more about defining our own functions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment statements are not expressions!\n\n\n\nStatements, when executed, do something. Expressions are a type of statement that, when executed, evaluate to values. In Jupyter Notebook code cells, if the last statement in a cell is not an expression, executing that last statement will not produce an output.\nThe first cell above does not end in an expression and therefore does not produce output. The second cell above has two statements; the last one is an expression, which is displayed in the cell output.\n\n\nConsider the below Python code:\n\nx = 4\ny = max(-2, 9) + x\n\nPython executes these two statements sequentially: first, Line 1 is an assignment statement that assigns the name x to 4. Then, Line 2 assigns the name y to the result of evaluating the right-hand-side.",

    "section": "Style and Debugging",
    "text": "Style and Debugging\nYou may have noticed by now that Jupyter Notebooks are not just by computers to run code. Data scientists also use notebooks to understand how the code facilitates data analysis. We’d therefore like to establish two habits early:\n\nProgramming Style and Comments\nProgramming style involves writing code that is self-evident and understandable by other human beings. It is not sufficient for your code to be functional, i.e., perform the correct computation. It should also be readable and interpretable, for others to reuse and adapt.\nGood style practices can involve comments, meaningful names, whitespace, markdown cells interspersed with code cells, etc. Ch 3.2 of Inferential Thinking describes meaningful names; we discuss comments below.\nComments are used to explain what code does. Good programmers write code that is self-evident and use comments only where necessary.\nIn Python, you can write comments in the same line as code (“in-line” comments) using #:\n\n3 + 4     # simple arithmetic\n\n7\n\n\nThe above shows that both code and comments can be on the same line. In that line, anything after # is a comment and is not evaluated.\n\n\nDebugging\nDebugging is the process of fixing errors, i.e., bugs, in code. Debugging is a huge process and can take up the majority of your coding time.\nErrors in your code can pop up for any number of reasons! Here are some tips:\nTest your code early and often. If you write a lot of code before testing, then you have that much more code to debug and check. Instead, write a bit, test and check, and keep writing. This will require you to know how to decompose, or break down, your solutions into multiple steps that you can test individually. Once you’re comfortable with one step, move onto the next step. That’s right—it’s abstraction!_ Debugging your code will help you better understand computational concepts.\nGet familiar with reading error messages. When Python errors, it may give messages that are initially cryptic. Try the following.\n\nTake a deep breath.\nActually read the message—don’t just focus on what you think it might say. The error message will often include a meaningful name (e.g., SyntaxError or ZeroDivisionError), the line, and an arrow (marked by ^) to where the error occurred.\nThen, try to explain to yourself why this error occurred, before fixing the error. Many beginning programmers will want skip this step, opting to throw everything at the wall and then, once things are fixed, explain what happened. Instead, slow down and try to understand the problem first. Then the solution will be straightforward.\n\nTrace your code, but not at the expense of testing. Code tracing is the process of analyzing Python code, statement by statement and line by line, to understand program execution. This is a visual process and can sometimes be helped along by diagrams. Learning to trace code is learning procedural thinking—it is a key skill that helps break down exactly what your code is doing. Once you get the hang of tracing your code, you may be tempted to debug by just staring at your code—don’t do this! Instead, develop a healthy balance between developing an understanding of your code and testing if your code does what you expect.\n\n\nPractice with Errors\nTry these on for size:\nSyntax errors are errors in writing “valid” Python that cannot even create nonsensical Python code.\n\n3 ** / 4\n\n\n  Cell In[6], line 1\n    3 ** / 4\n         ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n\n\nWhy might the below code not error? (Hint: What does - represent?)\n\n9 ** - .5\n\n0.3333333333333333\n\n\nOnce you fix syntax errors, you may still encounter functionality errors, which can be errors caused during execution that leads to your program crashing. Here’s one common one:\n\n5 / 0\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[8], line 1\n----&gt; 1 5 / 0\n\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n\n\n\n```",

One of the most common examples is a table:\n\nA rectangular data structure composed of rows and columns. Columns are labeled.\n\nWe will expand on this definition of table over the next few lectures.\n\n\nRates\nA rate is a measure of one quantity per unit of some other quantity. A few examples: 6 miles per hour, 70%, 4.8 parts per million. Rates are often expressed as a percentage, fraction with a numerator and a denominator, or a decimal number.\nData scientists often use and define rates to compare different situations or events. For example, it is easy to compare 60 mph to 40 mph, but harder to compare 15 mph to 10 km/s. Occasionally, it’s unclear why a rate is necessary until we dig into the data. Let’s inspect a particular case below.",

    "text": "Rates: Incidence\nThe U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) regularly examines disease data nationwide and publishes reports for the public. These reports help inform public health policy and consequent responses to disease epidemics at the national and global levels. One such disease is Tuberculosis (TB), a highly contagious respiratory infection.\nConsider the reported U.S. TB cases in 2021 (CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) 03/25/2022, source). The report summary states:\n\nReported TB incidence (cases per 100,000 persons) increased 9.4%, from 2.2 during 2020 to 2.4 during 2021 but was lower than incidence during 2019 (2.7). Increases occurred among both U.S.-born and non–U.S.-born persons.\n\nWhile the report discusses possible interpretations as to why this occurred, let’s focus on this particular numeric summary by answering the following questions:\n\nDefine: What is incidence? Incidence is a rate. Why use this rate for comparison, and not the total number of cases?\nVerify: Consider Table 1. How can we use Python to verify that the TB incidence column can be computed from the TB cases column? How can use Python to verify the reported percent change in incidence?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the tabular data\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of information on the CDC website—more than we can cover in this example. Our main goal is to understand the numeric data presented in the summary statement quoted above. There are two sources of information relevant to us:\n\nThe quote above, taken from the webpage summary.\nTable 1, located at the bottom of the webpage.\n\nBefore continuing, try reading Table 1.

    "section": "Define: Incidence",
    "text": "Define: Incidence\nIn epidemiology, incidence is a rate that measures the number of cases of a disease in a population, within a given time period, as shown in Equation 1:\n\\[ \\text{TB incidence} = \\frac{\\text{\\# TB cases}}{\\text{population}} \\tag{1}\\]\nThis rate can be interpreted as the number of cases (i.e., the number of reported individuals diagnosed with TB) per person (the number of people in the population).\nWhy not use TB cases? Why scale by population size? Based on the CDC summary, the intention of this report was to highlight a drop in TB cases in 2020, compared to adjacent years. The report accomplished this by reporting and comparing the TB incidence in 2019, 2020, and 2021.\nSimply reporting the total number of TB cases has several pitfalls, including the inability to compare the prevalence of TB in different scenarios.\nWhile the precise explanation requires a strong understanding of probability (see Data 140), intuitively, incidence is a proxy for the prevalence, or rate of occurrence, of TB cases occurring in a population. As an example, Hawaii reported much fewer TB cases than California, but had a much higher TB incidence, across all three years. After all, Hawaii has a much smaller population than California (1.5 million vs. 39 million), so each case of reported TB matters more.\n\nNext, let’s consider how the CDC defines TB incidence in this report. From the Table 1 footnote:\n\nCases per 100,000 persons using midyear population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nIncorrect interpretation. First, consider the following (incorrect) ratio in Equation 2:\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{\\# TB cases}}{100,000 \\text{ persons}} \\tag{2}\\]\nThis rate does not account for different states having different population sizes. In other words, the population denominator in Equation 1 has disappeared.\nCorrect interpretation. Incidence is a measure of the rate of occurrence of a disease across a population. The Table 1 footnote translates Equation 1 to consider different ways of measuring the population.\nIf TB incidence in Equation 1 was defined as number of TB cases per person, we scale up by 100,000 to define TB cases per group, where the group is defined as 100,000 persons. \\[\n\\frac{\\text{cases}}{\\text{1 person}} \\times \\frac{100,000 \\text{ persons}}{\\text{group}}\n\\]\nThe CDC definition of TB incidence is therefore represented by Equation 3:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{\\# TB cases}}{\\# \\text{people in population}} \\times 100,000\n\\tag{3}\\]",
