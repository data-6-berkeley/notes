## File Storage

How do we store data in a computer? We use Python **names** to store information within our Python programs. But in order to share information with other people, we need to store it in a **file**.
We can use files to generate tables, or other useful data structures
Files are often stored in **folders**.

We can categorize data as being in one of two broad categories:

* **Tabular Data**: Data is organized into rows and columns.
    * Example formats: XLS/XLSX, **CSV**, DB, ...
    * Applications: Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, SQLite, Jupyter Notebooks + datascience, ...
* **Non-Tabular Data**: Data is organized in some other way:
    * Example Formats: TXT, DOC, JSON, JPG, MP3, MP4, ...
    * Applications: It really depends!

## Tabular Data

### CSV

**Comma-Separated Values, or CSV, is a file format consisting of lines of text. The CSV format stores tabular data, where

* Each line is a row of values.
* Each value is separated by a comma (hence, the name).
* Each row has the same number of comma-separated values.

Typically, the first line of the file is assumed to be a row of column labels. The `pups.csv` file:

```
name,age,breed
Junior Smith,11,cockapoo
Rex Rogers,7,labradoodle
Flash Heat,3,labrador
Reese Bo,4,boston terrier
Polo Cash,2,shih tzu
```

Most of the data we use in this class is in the CSV format. To load a CSV file into a table, provide the file name:

```{python}
pups = Table.read_table("data/pups.csv")
pups
```

### Aside: File Paths

The below syntax loads data from a CSV located at `file_path` (a string describing the location of the relevant file) into a table named `tbl`.

```python
tbl = Table.read_table(file_path)
```

In our example `pups` case, the `pups.csv` file is located in the `data` directory (say, on DataHub), so our argument to `read_table` is the string `"data/pups.csv"`. The argument to `file_path` could also be a link to a CSV on the internet.

## Non-Tabular Data

What kinds of data can’t be stored in a tabular format? Lots of things: music, videos, maps, etc. Graph data and hierarchical data, like family trees, might also be non-tabular.

:::{style="text-align: center"}
![A family tree graph structure. At the root is Grandma, who has children Dad and Aunt. Dad has children Brother and Me, and Aunt has children Cousin 1 and Cousin 2. Cousin 2 has a one child, Cousin 2 Jr.](images/trees.png){#fig-inflation fig-align=center width=75%}

### JSON

JSON, which stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**, is a file format that allows us to store **hierarchical data**.
Main features of a JSON file:
* Curly braces denote the start of a series of key-value pairs (e.g., dictionary).
    * Valid keys are strings and numbers (integers and floats).
    * Valid values are strings, numbers, dictionaries, and lists.
* Square brackets denote the start of a sequence (e.g., list).
    * Valid elements are strings, numbers, dictionaries, and lists.

While whitespace makes the `family.json` file quite long, it helps organize the JSON for human view. You can put as much or as little whitespace in JSON files as you want.

```
{
  "name": "Grandma",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "Dad",
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "Me"
        },
        {
          "name": "Brother"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Aunt",
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "Cousin 1"
        },
        {
          "name": "Cousin 2",
          "children": [
            {
              "name": "Cousin 2 Jr."
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


The JSON format looks very similar to the syntax we use for defining dictionaries in Python.
Technically, JSON can be also used to store tabular data, but it’s far less elegant than just using a CSV.

In lab, you will see an example of how to load JSON files into dictionaries. We will generally provide this starter code for you.
