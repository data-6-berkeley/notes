## 📖 Lecture

You don't need to be an expert programmer to be a data scientist, but learning more about programming allows you to automate common tasks, and solve new problems with greater ease.

This week we'll discuss how to write basic functions, the notion of _compound_ expressions in R, and an introduction to conditionals (i.e. if-else statements).

 

## 📚 Reading

Read chapters 10, 11, and 12 of "R Coding Basics":

## 🔬 Lab

You will get your hands “dirty” writing basic functions, and conditional statements.



## 🎯 Objectives

At the end of this week you will be able to:

- Describe the main parts of a function (i.e. anatomy of a function)
- Give a simple example for creating a function
- Explain the concept of an R compound expression
- Write if-else statements to handle simple conditions
- Use if-else statements when writing functions to decide what code to execute
 


## 🔆 Shiny Friday

The shiny app for this week is a modified version of the default "Old Faithful" app.

The main modification has to do with the use of an if-statement to decide whether to display additional statistics on the histogram of `waiting` times.

More specifically, we have three new versions:

- __old-faithful3-average-radio__: includes radio buttons to display line of average waiting time <br>

- __old-faithful4-average-checkbox__: includes a checkbox to display line of average waiting time <br>

- __old-faithful5-statistics__: includes an auxiliary function to compute descriptive statistics, and also a checkbox to display descriptive statistics <br>
