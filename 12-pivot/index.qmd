::: {.callout-note title="Read _Inferential Thinking_"}
 Read [Ch 8.3](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/08/3/Cross-Classifying_by_More_than_One_Variable.html), which describes grouping by multiple columns and a cross-tabulation concept called **pivoting**.

 * You understand the optional arguments to the `pivot` method: `values` and `collect`.
