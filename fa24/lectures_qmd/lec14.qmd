## Slide 13: What is Visualization?

## Slide 14: Visualizations are for humans

## Slide 15: Visualize, then quantify!

- These datasets all have several statistical properties in common ‚Äì means, standard deviations, and correlations ‚Äì but look very different when plotted.
- Visualization complements statistics. You can explore this more in future statistics courses.

## Slide 16: What‚Äôs the point of visualization?

- Creating good visualizations is an art as much it is a science; there is often no ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way to visualize data.
- We must be careful and deliberate when visualizing data, especially if our visualizations are going to be used in the real-world.
- If you want to look at some creative, sophisticated visualizations, see
- The John Hunter Excellence in Plotting Contest.

## Slide 17: Variable Types

- 1. Examples of Visualization
- 2. What is Visualization?
- 3. Variable Types
- 4. Encoding
- ‚û§

## Slide 18: Variable Types

- Suppose we have some data and want to create a visualization.
- Question: How do we know what kind of visualization to create? ü§î
- Answer: It depends on the type(s) of information we want to visualize.
  - Bar charts work sometimes. But not all the time!
- Where we are visualizing different variables (features) of a dataset, a lot depends on the type(s) of variables we‚Äôre working with:
- Variable types are different from data types like string, int, Table, etc.
- In the next few slides we‚Äôll study the different variable feature types, in order to make more informed decisions when creating visualizations.

## Slide 19: Can do arithmetic with.

- Can do arithmetic with.
- Cannot do arithmetic with.
- Variable Type

## Slide 20: Example: Area Codes

- Just because a variable has numbers for values does not make it numerical.
- Similarly, a numerical variable might be stored as a string ‚Äì in that case, you‚Äôll need to convert the corresponding values to ints or floats, depending on what is appropriate.
- Warning: a categorical variable can have numbers for values!

## Slide 21: Quick Check 1

- Determine the variable feature type of each of the following variables.
- Fuel economy in miles per gallon.
- Number of semesters at Berkeley.
- Class standing (freshman, sophomore, etc.).
- Income bracket (low, medium, high).
- Bank account number.

## Slide 22: Encoding

- 1. Examples of Visualization
- 2. What is Visualization?
- 3. Variable Types
- 4. Encoding
- ‚û§

## Slide 23: Encoding

- An encoding is a mapping from a variable to a visual element.
- For instance, in bar charts, length can visually encode a numerical variable (here, the average age).
- Longer bar = higher average age.

## Slide 24: ‚Äπ\#‚Ä∫

- How many variables are being encoded in this plot?

## Slide 25: What‚Äôs Wrong?

- This graph implies that Swedish cars are ‚Äúgreater‚Äù than cars from other countries in some sense, when they‚Äôre not.
- The variable type determines the types of plots (and hence, encodings) that are appropriate.
- Over the next few weeks, we will learn how to create several kinds of plots and learn when each is appropriate.

## Slide 26: In Conclusion‚Ä¶

## Slide 27: Summary

- It is often easier to discern patterns in our data when we visualize it rather than looking at it in a table.
  - We visualize to further our understanding of our results and to communicate our results with others.
- There are two main kinds of statistical variable types ‚Äì numerical and categorical.
  - Numerical variables are either discrete or continuous, while categorical variables are either ordinal or nominal.
  - Categorical variables may be stored as numbers! (area codes)
- Encodings translate variables into visual properties.
    - Not all encodings work for all variables ‚Äì we‚Äôll learn more about this soon.

## Slide 28: Coming Up‚Ä¶

## Slide 29: Visualization tools

- Without a computer:
  - Drawing
  - Painting
- With a computer:
  - Without programming:
    - Photoshop
    - Figma
    - Tableau
  - With programming:
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - plotly
    - D3.js
- There are many Python visualization libraries that integrate well with tables.
- This is nowhere near a comprehensive list!
- Both are popular but less ‚Äúmodern‚Äù
- Newer, and can create interactive visualizations.
