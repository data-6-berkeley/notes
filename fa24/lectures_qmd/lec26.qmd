## Slide 14: Where Do You Go From Here?

- There are numerous possibilities. Do the one that makes you happy!
- Pretend like you never took this class and continue learning about ideas that truly interest you.
- Don‚Äôt take any other data science courses, but try and use what you‚Äôve learned in this class in your field of interest.
- Take Data 8 and minor in data science while majoring in your field of interest.
- Take Data 8 and major in data science while also majoring in your field of interest, or major in just data science.
- Take CS 61A and major in computer science (and another major).
- Look into a computer science or data science graduate program
- Whichever route you choose, you‚Äôre more than equipped to handle what‚Äôs in front of you.

## Slide 15: More About DS/CS Courses

## Slide 16: Data 8: Foundations of Data Science

- Exploration
- Inference
- Prediction
- Identifying patterns in data
- Uses visualizations
- Using data to draw reliable conclusions about the world
- Uses statistics
- Making informed guesses about unobserved data
- Uses machine learning
- Learning about the world from data using computation.

## Slide 17: Data 8 Connector Courses

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Many members of our teams got more involved in the data science community by taking these classes.
Show the connection of Data Science to various other fields.
Usually 2 units, many feature term projects, legal studies, cognitive science, geography, sports analytics, immunotherapy

## Slide 18: CS 61A and CS 88

- CS 61A is a 4 unit programming course
  - Introduction (and deep dive) into Python (and other programming languages)
  - Students with no programming experience can do well, but having taken a coding course like Data 6 beforehand will help your understanding
  - Goes deeper into programming topics, does not focus on data science principles
  - Aimed at people who want general programming experience and for people studying the computer sciences
- Data C88C is a 3 unit programming course designed for students who took Data 8
  - Covers similar topics as CS 61A (many shared assignments), but omits the ideas that are not core to data science

## Slide 19: Data science major vs. minor

- Major Requirements
- Core Data Science Classes  - Data 8, 100, 140/Stat 134
- Computational/Inferential Depth - includes CS 61A or 88, 61B
- Human Context and Ethics
- Domain Emphasis - great for double majoring!
- Minor Requirements
- Core Data Science Classes  - Data 8, 100
- Computational/Inferential Depth - includes CS 61A or 88, lower division probability
- Human Context and Ethics
- Electives

## Slide 20: Upper Division Courses ‚Äì Data 100 and Data 140

- Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science (Required)
- Prereqs: Data 8, CS 61A or CS 88, linear algebra (concurrent ok)
- Practical: Industry-standard data manipulation (pandas, SQL, regex), visualization, and introductory machine learning ‚Äì need this to work as a data analyst
- Theoretical: Theory behind core statistical techniques (complements Data 140)
- Data 140: Probability for Data Science (Satisfies DS probability requirement)
- Prereqs: Data 8, calculus, linear algebra (concurrent ok)
- Theoretical background for advanced statistical methods, including machine learning
- Not crucial for working as a data analyst, but necessary if you want to do any kind of modeling or advanced statistics
- Take them in either order!

<details><summary>Speaker notes</summary>

Data 100 covers a wide range of topics - you begin with pandas, then visualization, EDA and then jump into ML. A student gets to see a lot of sides what it is like to be a data scientist. It empowers students with a lot of practical skills that they can utilize in doing projects on their own.
