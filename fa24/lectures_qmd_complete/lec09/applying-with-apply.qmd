## .apply()

- The method
- t.apply(function, column\_or\_columns)
- applies function to every element in column\_or\_columns, and returns an array with the results.
- If you only supply one column name, function should only take one argument.
- If you supply X column names, function should take X arguments.

## Masks with Tables

- We can achieve the same behavior with tables – by using where with just a single argument.
- Previously, where required two arguments.
- Just one argument: a list of booleans.
