## Masks and Arrays

- Masking – also known as boolean indexing – is the process of indexing into an array or table with a array of booleans.
- Only the elements at indexes 0 and 3.

## Masks with Tables

- We can achieve the same behavior with tables – by using where with just a single argument.
- Previously, where required two arguments.
- Just one argument: a list of booleans.
