## What is a computer program? What is code?

- Code refers to a computer program writtenin a particular programming language.
- In this class, we use the Python language to write Python code.
- A computer program is a [set or sequence] of instructions in a programming language.				[Wikipedia]
- Computer programs are nothing more than recipes: we write programs that tell the computer exactly what to do, and it does exactly that – nothing more, and nothing less.
- Common (cold) take: computers are dumb.

## Where do we write code?

- Traditionally, code is written in a text editor or IDE, and then run in a command-line interface.
- VS Code, a popular text editor.
- Command Line Interface
- While we could do everything in command-line interfaces, they aren’t the best suited for data science work, which often requires visualizations and written reports.

## Where do we write code?

- Jupyter Notebooks allow us to write and run code within a single document. They also allow us to embedded text and code. We will use these exclusively!
- You will learn about more coding tools if you take more CS/DS classes.

## Why write code as a data scientist?

- Compute
- Visualize
- Share
