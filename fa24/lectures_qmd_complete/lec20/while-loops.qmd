## Two Types of Loops

- Loops allow us to repeat the execution of code.
- There are two types of loops in Python: the while loop and the for loop.
- while <boolean expression>:
- <while body>
- “While this condition is true, repeat this code.”
- for <elem> in <sequence>:
- <for body>
- “For each element of this sequence, repeat this code.”
- Sequences include arrays, lists, strings and more.

## While Loops

- While loops repeat the code in their body while a certain boolean expression is True.
- While loops are often used when we don’t know how many times we need our loop to repeat
- We often keep track of some sort of counter and check it is above, below, or equal to a certain value.
