## Scatter Plots

- Scatter plots are used to visualize two numerical variables at once. To create a scatter plot from a table, you need two columns:
- A numerical column for the x-axis.
- A numerical column for the y-axis.
- The resulting graph has one point for every row in your table.
- We call this a graph of ‚Äúy vs. x‚Äù

## .scatter()

- The method t.scatter(column\_for\_x, column\_for\_y)
- creates a scatter plot using the specified columns. Both columns must contain numerical values.
- If only column\_for\_x is provided, a separate scatter plot is drawn for every other column in t (similar to the behavior of barh).
- ‚ÄúOn average, as the number of points a player averages increases, the number of assists they average also increases.‚Äù

## Motivating Line Plots

- While a scatter plot would theoretically work in such a scenario, there are some key differences that lead us to another type of plot.
- There‚Äôs only one y for every x.
  - There‚Äôs only one number of COVID cases per day.
  - There can be many people with the same height when graphing weight vs. height.
- We want to emphasize a trend by ‚Äúconnecting the dots‚Äù.
  - ü§î
- What if we want to visualize two numerical variables, but one of them is time?
- COVID cases per day in Alameda County.
- Average rainfall for each month of the year in San Diego.

## Multiple Line Plots

- If we provide plot with only a single column name, it will draw lines for every other column in your table.
- If you want to do this, make sure to select columns first!

## Scatter Plots vs. Line Plots

- Line plots visualize the relationship between two numerical variables ‚Äî one of them is ordered.
- x-axis generally represents time or distance.
- There should only be one y value for every x value.
- Useful for identifying trends over time
- Scatter plots visualize the relationship between any two numerical variables.
- No need to have unique x (or y) values.
- Useful for identifying patterns between variables

## Summary: scatter

- The method t.scatter(column\_for\_x, column\_for\_y)creates a scatter plot using the specified columns. Both columns must contain numerical values.
- Optional arguments, in addition to xaxis\_title, width, etc:
- s (int): changes default size of all points.
- sizes (str): point sizes will be proportional to the values in this numerical column.
- group (str): points will be colored according to category in this categorical column.
- labels (str): points will be labeled according to their value in this column.
