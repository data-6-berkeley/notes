- LECTURE 05
- What it means to work with data.
- Developed by students and faculty at UC Berkeley and Tuskegee University

## Indexing

- ➤
- 1. Array Functions
- 2. NumPy
- 3. Indexing

## Array Indexing

- We can access an element in an array by using its index and the item() method:
- arr.item(index)
- Though int\_arr has 5 elements, the largest valid index is 4.

## Negative Indexing

- We can also “count backwards” using negative indexes.
- -1 corresponds to the last element in a array.
- -2 corresponds to the second last element in a array.
- And so on...
