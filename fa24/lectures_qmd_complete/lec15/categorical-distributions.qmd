## Visualizing Categorical and Numerical Variables

- Data 6 Fall 2024
- LECTURE 15
- All about histograms and bar charts.
- Developed by students and faculty at UC Berkeley and Tuskegee University

## Variable Types and Distributions

- 1. Categorical Distributions
- 2. Bar Charts
- 3. Grouped Bar Charts

## Variable Distributions

- Given a specific dataset, a variable has a distribution:
- For each different value of the variable, the frequency of individuals that have that value.
- Frequency: number or percent of individuals (depends on definition of “individual”; more later)
- A distribution table of the categorical variable Cookie. Each row represents a different value of Cookie.
- A bar chart that plots the distribution of the categorical variable Cookie.

## Summary (Categorical Variables)

- Bar charts are used to display the distribution of a categorical variable, or the relationship between a categorical variable and one or more numerical variables.
- The method t.barh(column\_for\_categories) creates a bar chart with:
- The values of the column column\_for\_categories as the categories on the y-axis. This column should contain a categorical variable, and values should be unique.
- Bars for every other column in t. These columns should contain numerical variables.
  - Multiple other columns → grouped bar chart.
- Bars should be sorted depending on the type of the categorical variable.

## Numerical Distributions, Histograms

- 2. Numerical Distributions, Histograms
- 3. Choosing Bins
- 4. Overlaid and Side-by-Side Histograms

## Towards Numerical Distributions

- Bar charts visualize the distribution of a categorical variable, or the relationship between a categorical variable and one or more numerical variables.
- Bar charts cannot display the distribution of a numerical variable.
- Question: How might we display the distribution of a numerical variable?
- Answer: One solution is to combine ranges of values into bins.
