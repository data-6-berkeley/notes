## A Note on Bins

- By looking at a histogram, we cannot tell how values are distributed within a bin.

## Bins

- .hist chooses bins by default for us.
- The resulting histogram often looks nice, but has non-integer bins which are harder for us to interpret.
- We can choose our own bins.
- We will only consider histograms where all bins have equal width, though it is possible to draw histograms where bins have unequal width.
