## Disaggregation and Privacy

- Public dataset by geographic region
- The ACS main webpage [link] provides an aggregated view of data by region and specific disaggregations by income and sex.
- By doing so, researchers can find it difficult (if not impossible) to disentangle the impact of certain variables, e.g., by race/ethnicity.
- ACS has therefore also released ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) [link] which releases a smaller sample of records from individual people and/or housing units.
- Why the distinction?
- Releasing fine-grained data about individuals is a privacy issue.
  - It puts individuals in that dataset at risk of being identified beyond the research.
  - In particular, small, already vulnerable populations are often more easily identified.
- PUMS therefore uses a combination of privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy and synthetic data [source1, source2]
