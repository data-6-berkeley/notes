## Computation and Randomness

- Question: What problem does this pose?
- Answer: Computers cannot, on their own, generate truly random numbers. Soâ€¦ now what? ðŸ¤”
- Computer programs take our instructions (code) and execute them. Their outputs are entirely predictable.
- Randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events. (Some events may be more likely than others.)
