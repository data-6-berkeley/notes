## Truthy Values

- It turns out that almost everything evaluates to True when converted to bool.
- These are pretty much the only exceptions (these all evaluate to False):
- False
- ''(the empty string)
- 0 (and hence 0.0)
- None
- Generally things that are empty (empty lists, sets, dictionaries, etc)
- If something evaluates to True when converted to bool, we call it a truthy value. Otherwise, we call it a falsy value.

## Truthy Values in Practice

- Conditional statements use the truthiness of an expression.
