## Boolean operators

- Boolean operators allow us to combine the result of multiple booleans.
- and and or operate on two (or more) operands; not operates on just one.

## Compound boolean expressions

- Things can get pretty wacky!
- 3 < 4 <= 5                  \# True
- 3 < 4 > 2 < 11 > -1         \# True
- 3 < 4 < 2 > 11 > -1         \# False
- But again, just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should.
- The first line is fine, but don’t use the latter two.
