## If Statements

- If statements are used to control which lines of code are run, according to some boolean expression(s).
- The most basic if-statement includes just one header: if.
- if <boolean expression>:
- <if body>
- If <boolean expression> is True, <if body> is run. Otherwise, it is not run

## If-Else

- Optionally, you can also use the else header. Use else if you want your code to do something in the event that <boolean expression> is False.
- if <boolean expression>:
- <if body>
- else:
- <else body>
- If <boolean expression> is True, <if body> is run.
- If <boolean expression> is False, <else body> is run.
