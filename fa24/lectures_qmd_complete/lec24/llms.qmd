## Defining Large Language Models (LLMs)

- Question: What is a LLM?
- Answer: A LLM is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. LLMs are trained on huge sets of data — hence the name "large." LLMs are built on machine learning: specifically, a type of neural network called a transformer model.
- Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)
- are LLMs
- So… you’ve potentially used LLMs (hopefully following academic guidelines).
