## Variable Types

- Suppose we have some data and want to create a visualization.
- Question: How do we know what kind of visualization to create? ðŸ¤”
- Answer: It depends on the type(s) of information we want to visualize.
  - Bar charts work sometimes. But not all the time!
- Where we are visualizing different variables (features) of a dataset, a lot depends on the type(s) of variables weâ€™re working with:
- Variable types are different from data types like string, int, Table, etc.
- In the next few slides weâ€™ll study the different variable feature types, in order to make more informed decisions when creating visualizations.
