## Pivot

::: {.callout-note title="Read _Inferential Thinking_"}
 Read [Ch 8.3](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/08/3/Cross-Classifying_by_More_than_One_Variable.html), which describes grouping by multiple columns and a cross-tabulation concept called **pivoting**.
 
 Before continuing, make sure that:

 * You can compare and contrast how `group` and `pivot` aggregate data.
 * You understand the optional arguments to the `pivot` method: `values` and `collect`.

## Join

::: {.callout-note title="Read _Inferential Thinking_"}
 Read [Ch 8.4](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/08/4/Joining_Tables_by_Columns.html), which joins tables together.
 
 Before continuing, make sure that:
 
 * You understand how joining one table on another augments the information in a table.
 * You can identify the appropriate shared column on which to join two tables.
 * You can compare and contrast the use cases for the different function signatures of the `join` Table method:

    * `tblA.join(colA, tblB)`
    * `tblA.join(colA, tblB, colB)`
