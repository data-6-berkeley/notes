## Tutorial: HTML And BeautifulSoup

BeautifulSoup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

Please see Professor Allison Parrish's [tutorial on HTML and BeautifulSoup](https://github.com/aparrish/dmep-python-intro/blob/master/scraping-html.ipynb), which we go over in class.

The official [BeautifulSoup Documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) is also a great place to continue searching for that exact feature you want.
