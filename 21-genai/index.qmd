**Generative Artificial Intelligence**, also known as Generative AI or GenAI, refers to models that generate responses, often to user input.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large language models (LLMs) are the hallmark of machine learning models for Generative AI. LLMs take as text as input and output text.

Refer to these slides for the high-level idea of how large language models probabilistically generate content:

Focus on:

* Understanding the difference between an LLM (e.g., GPT) and a chatbot that uses an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
* Know that chatbots can be powered by different models, which have different capacities.
* Understand the risks of hallucinations and other inaccuracies when it comes to generative models.
